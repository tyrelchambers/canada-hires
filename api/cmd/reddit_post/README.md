# Reddit Post CLI Tool

A command-line tool for manually posting job postings to Reddit for testing purposes.

## Usage

```bash
# Basic usage - post a job to Reddit
go run cmd/reddit_post/main.go <job_posting_id>

# Preview the post without actually submitting (dry run)
go run cmd/reddit_post/main.go --dry-run <job_posting_id>

# Force post even if job is already marked as posted
go run cmd/reddit_post/main.go --force <job_posting_id>

# Override the subreddit for testing
go run cmd/reddit_post/main.go --subreddit testsubreddit <job_posting_id>
```

## Environment Variables

### Required
- `REDDIT_ID`: Reddit app client ID (required)
- `REDDIT_SECRET`: Reddit app client secret (required) 
- `REDDIT_USERNAME`: Reddit username (must be registered as app developer) (required)
- `REDDIT_PASSWORD`: Reddit password (required)

### Optional
- `REDDIT_TEST_SUBREDDIT`: Override the default subreddit for testing
- `REDDIT_USER_AGENT`: Reddit API user agent (defaults to "JobWatchCanada/1.0")

## Features

- **Job Lookup**: Accepts either job posting UUID or JobBankID
- **Preview Mode**: `--dry-run` shows what would be posted without actually submitting
- **Force Mode**: `--force` allows reposting jobs already marked as posted
- **Subreddit Override**: CLI flag or environment variable to test in different subreddits
- **Automatic Authentication**: Fetches and caches Reddit access tokens automatically
- **Token Management**: Automatically refreshes expired tokens
- **Automatic Status Update**: Marks jobs as posted in database when successful

## Reddit App Setup

Before using this tool, you need to create a Reddit app:

1. Go to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/
2. Click "Create App" or "Create Another App"
3. Choose "script" as the app type
4. Fill in name and description
5. Set redirect URI (not used for script apps, can be http://localhost)
6. Note the client ID (under the app name) and client secret
7. Ensure your Reddit username is registered as a developer for this app

## Notes

- The tool automatically tries to find jobs by UUID first, then by JobBankID
- Posts are marked as `reddit_posted = true` in the database upon successful submission
- Reddit API rate limits apply - use responsibly for testing
- Access tokens are automatically fetched and cached (expire after ~1 hour)
- Ensure your Reddit app has proper permissions for posting to target subreddits
