-- This migration is a placeholder for backfilling historical LMIA statistics
-- The actual backfill should be performed after the application starts up
-- by calling the API endpoint: POST /api/lmia/statistics/backfill

-- This file exists to maintain proper migration sequence
-- No actual data operations are performed here to avoid long-running migrations
